This project transmits a bunch of TV POWER codes, one right after the other, 
with a pause in between each.  (To have a visible indication that it is 
transmitting, it also pulses a visible LED once each time a POWER code is 
transmitted.)  That is all TV-B-Gone does.  The tricky part of TV-B-Gone 
was collecting all of the POWER codes, and getting rid of the duplicates and 
near-duplicates (because if there is a duplicate, then one POWER code will 
turn a TV off, and the duplicate will turn it on again (which we certainly 
do not want).  I have compiled the most popular codes with the 
duplicates eliminated, both for North America (which is the same as Asia, as 
far as POWER codes are concerned -- even though much of Asia USES PAL video) 
and for Europe (which works for Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and 
other parts of the world that use PAL video).

Before creating a TV-B-Gone Kit, I originally started this project by hacking 
the MiniPOV kit.  This presents a limitation, based on the size of
the Atmel ATtiny2313 internal flash memory, which is 2KB.  With 2KB we can only 
fit about 7 POWER codes into the firmware's database of POWER codes.  However,
the more codes the better! Which is why we chose the ATtiny85 for the 
TV-B-Gone Kit.

This version of the firmware has the most popular 100+ POWER codes for 
North America and 100+ POWER codes for Europe. You can select which region 
to use by soldering a 10K pulldown resistor.

/*
The hardware for this project is very simple:
     ATtiny85 has 8 pins:
       pin 1   RST + Button
       pin 2   one pin of ceramic resonator MUST be 8.0 mhz
       pin 3   other pin of ceramic resonator
       pin 4   ground
       pin 5   OC1A - IR emitters, through a '2907 PNP driver that connects 
               to 4 (or more!) PN2222A drivers, with 1000 ohm base resistor 
               and also connects to programming circuitry
       pin 6   Region selector. Float for US, 10K pulldown for EU,
               also connects to programming circuitry
       pin 7   PB0 - visible LED, and also connects to programming circuitry
       pin 8   +3-5v DC (such as 2-4 AA batteries!)
    See the schematic for more details.

    This firmware requires using an 8.0MHz ceramic resonator 
       (since the internal oscillator may not be accurate enough).

    IMPORTANT:  to use the ceramic resonator, you must perform the following:
                    make burn-fuse_cr

/*
The C compiler creates code that will transfer all constants into RAM when 
the microcontroller resets.  Since this firmware has a table (powerCodes) 
that is too large to transfer into RAM, the C compiler needs to be told to 
keep it in program memory space.  This is accomplished by the macro PROGMEM 
(this is used in the definition for powerCodes).  Since the C compiler assumes 
that constants are in RAM, rather than in program memory, when accessing
powerCodes, we need to use the pgm_read_word() and pgm_read_byte macros, and 
we need to use powerCodes as an address.  This is done with PGM_P, defined 
below.  
For example, when we start a new powerCode, we first point to it with the 
following statement:
    PGM_P thecode_p = pgm_read_word(powerCodes+i);
The next read from the powerCode is a byte that indicates the carrier 
frequency, read as follows:
      const uint8_t freq = pgm_read_byte(code_ptr++);
After that is a byte that tells us how many 'onTime/offTime' pairs we have:
      const uint8_t numpairs = pgm_read_byte(code_ptr++);
The next byte tells us the compression method. Since we are going to use a
timing table to keep track of how to pulse the LED, and the tables are 
pretty short (usually only 4-8 entries), we can index into the table with only
2 to 4 bits. Once we know the bit-packing-size we can decode the pairs
      const uint8_t bitcompression = pgm_read_byte(code_ptr++);
Subsequent reads from the powerCode are n bits (same as the packing size) 
that index into another table in ROM that actually stores the on/off times
      const PGM_P time_ptr = (PGM_P)pgm_read_word(code_ptr);
