When we were putting together the TV-B-Gone kit, we started imagining a dystopian future, filled with televisions, where this kit would be super useful and we'd be a hero for having one.  And while maybe that's dramatic, the TV-B-Gone is perfect for playing pranks on your friends during the Super Bowl or getting some peace and quiet during dinner.

The TV-B-Gone is a kit that, when soldered together, allows you to turn off almost any television within 150 feet or more.  It works on over 230 total power codes - 115 American/Asian and another 115 European codes.  You can select which zone you want during kit assembly.

This is an unassembled kit which means that soldering is required - but itÕs very easy and a great introduction to soldering in general.  The kitÕs powered by 2x AA batteries - that arenÕt included - and the output comes from 2x narrow beam IR LEDs and 2x wide-beam IR LEDs.  

The TV-B-Gone covers almost any television from the brands listed below, including the latest flat-screens and plasma TVs.  There's also lots more info on the [TV-B-Gone website](https://learn.adafruit.com/tv-b-gone-kit).
